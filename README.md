# Approach taken: #

_Planning:_
## User Stories ##

* As a user, I want to categorize my expenses see how much I have spent on specific category
* As a user, I want to choose what expenses are redundant and choose not to spend money on those items anymore. 
* As a user, I want to track my savings and see the difference in my budget before and after I have implemented them.
